# Recommendation-System
Final year project: AI Recommendation System

Steps to run my recommendation system:

• Use Google Colab

• Make sure you use the T4 GPU (top right)

• Drag the python notebook into Colab

• Drag the MovieLens 100k small dataset files (movies.csv, tags.csv, ratings.csv)
into Colab

• Run each cell of the python notebook one by one (from top to bottom).
